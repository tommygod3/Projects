# year1-meta-assembler
This repository contains my first year C++ project I completed in term three.  
This project was for both the Computer Science Programming and Computer Technology & Maths modules.  
It was designed to be a meta assembler, the user could specify different opcode and  
appropriate machine code. The assembler would then compile a user program written in  
this assembly language and compile it to machine code.  
The assembler also has directives, such as EQU, ORG and labelling.  
The assembler was built with a specific use in mind, to power a CEDAR logic made  
virtual processor for educational purposes.  
An example of the program's inputs and outputs can be seen below:
